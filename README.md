# Detection-of-Driver-Cognitive-Distraction-using-GRU-model
This project focuses on detecting cognitive distraction in drivers using EEG (electroencephalogram), we collected data using Emotiv Epoc Flex device. 
The workflow involves several stages:



**Data Preprocessing:** Initial data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using EEGlab in MATLAB.

**Segmentation and Feature Extraction:** The data was then segmented and relevant features were extracted.

**Model Training:** A GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model was trained in Jupyter Notebook to classify cognitive distraction. The model achieved an accuracy of 93%.

Due to privacy concerns, the EEG data used in this project cannot be shared. The project aims to enhance road safety by providing real-time feedback on driver cognitive states through advanced machine learning techniques.
